Data Processing Approaches
1. Batch Processing
➤ Data is collected over a period (e.g., hourly, daily) and processed in groups (batches).

2. Stream Processing
➤ Data is processed as it arrives, continuously and in small increments.

3. Real-Time Processing
➤ Real-time systems process data as soon as it's generated with very low latency (milliseconds to seconds).

4. Near Real-Time Processing
➤ Data is almost instantly processed but with slight delay (a few seconds to a minute).
